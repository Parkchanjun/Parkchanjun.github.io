## Research Interest
My research philosophy is centered on service-driven research, aiming to bridge the gap between foundational theories in natural language processing (NLP) and their real-world applications. My primary interests include the development of efficient, purpose-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), with a focus on exploring their capability landscape across parameter regions and understanding how model scale and architecture shape emergent behaviors. I am also actively investigating how real-world phenomena can be systematically represented as text to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs. In addition, I am deeply engaged in cross-lingual NLP and multidisciplinary research that integrates insights from diverse domains to broaden the scope and impact of NLP technologies.
